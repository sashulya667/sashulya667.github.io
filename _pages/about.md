I'm a master's student in Data Science at [Universität Trier](https://www.uni-trier.de), Germany, with a broad interest in machine learning and AI research. My work spans language technologies, speech and optimization.

I've contributed to projects across academia, industry, and open-source from training speech models and analyzing LLM behavior to building real-time analytics pipelines and working with reinforcement learning on physical systems. Most recently, I’ve been involved with [Horde Research](https://huggingface.co/kz-transformers), an open-source Kazakh AI collective, and held research roles in labs in Germany, Canada, and Kazakhstan.

As I look ahead to PhD opportunities, I’m especially excited about research at the intersection of ML theory and practice: whether in NLP, ASR, world models, or generative methods like diffusion models. I'm drawn to labs that value rigor, creativity, and impact.
